# python-digital-filters
Project for the Digital Signal Processing university course. 
This project showcases an UI that shows the effects of the low pass filter on a sample from Music Sounds Better with You - Stardust.
The filter can be tuned via a vertical slider and in order to print the filtered stereo channels the user needs to press the "Draw New Graph" button. 
Both samples (the original one and the one that has been through the low pass filter) can be played in order to hear the difference between them.
